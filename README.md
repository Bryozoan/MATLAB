MATLAB CODE PROJECT:

This is a series of codes for preforming basic geostatistics in some common geologic applications. In each file there is a word document that explains the specific data it was built with, and give some interpretation. Although these are geared toward that specific dataset, they are designed to clearly outline what the statistics mean and how to interpret them.

Enjoy!
